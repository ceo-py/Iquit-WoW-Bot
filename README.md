A little bot that I made, so we can use it with my friends and check our progress, among other useful information about WOW.


You can test the bot functionality [here](https://discord.gg/gCcfWpMCgE)

Commands:

```code
!add
```

With that command you can add characters to the bot, then you can use that information to see the RIO rank you have and how it compares to your friends. Click on the button and fill up the fields with information.

```code
!rank
```

With that, you'll be able to see every character that you added in the bot with !add ranked and compare to the rest of the characters. If there are characters with 0 RIO they will not show. As an additional option, you have at the bottom to see the top 20 of every role and total.

```code
!check {region} {realm} {character name}
```

With that command, you'll be able to see more detail information about the character you ask for.

```code
!check {nickname} {class}
```

This is a quick check that you don't need to type {region} {realm} {character name} this will only work if you already add that character into the bot by **!add {region} {realm} {character name} {your nickname in discord, wow etc..} {class}**. If the character is not added to the bot, you can simply use then full check by **!check {region} {realm} {character name}**

```code
!update {hour}
```

This command will trigger auto check if someone in your server upgrade he's RIO from last check. The number __hour__ represent time intervals on the checks.
You can always stop it or change the time interval by giving new number. Keep in mind that time interval starts when you execute the command.


```code
!stop_update
```
This will stop auto update check for RIO.


```code
!token {region}
```
With this command, you'll be able to see token prices in the region you ask.
