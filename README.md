A little bot that i made so we can use it with my friends and check our progress among other useful information about WOW.


You can test the bot functionality here - > https://discord.gg/gCcfWpMCgE

Commands:


**!cadd {region} {realm} {character name} {your nickname in discord, wow etc..} {class}**

With that command you can add characters to the bot then you can use that information to see the raider io rank you have and how it comperes to your friends.

**!rank**

With that you`ll be able to see every character that you added in the bot with !cadd ranked and compere to the rest of the characters. If there are characters with 0 raider IO they will not show. As additional option you have at the bottom to see top 20 of every role and total.

**!check {region} {realm} {character name}**

With that command you`ll be able to see more detail information about the character you ask for.


**!check {your nickname in discord, wow etc..} {class}**

This is a quick check that you don't need to type {region} {realm} {character name} this will only work if you already add that character into the bot by **!cadd {region} {realm} {character name} {your nickname in discord, wow etc..} {class}**. If the character is not added to the bot you can simple use then full check by **!check {region} {realm} {character name}**
